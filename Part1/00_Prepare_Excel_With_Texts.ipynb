The s ituation is compounded by high HIV \\nprevalence with South Africa having the largest HIV  infection in the world. This case \\nstudy demonstrates how water and sanitation is used  as an entry point to address these \\nmajor challenges and to empower communities. The pr oject has two main \\ncomponents: the Small Medium Enterprise (SME) that trades in water and sanitation \\nfacilities and a community garden that ensure food security and nutrition for people \\nliving with HIV/AIDS. Income generated through thes e activities is ploughed back \\ninto the community through construction of sanitati on facilities, maintenance of water \\npipes and paying school fees for orphans. In additi on to creating employment, the \\nproject has also empowered the community to mobiliz e and address other challenges \\nsuch as gender, child abuse and crime.   \\nThe case study identifies weaknesses with projects designed solely to provide \\ndomestic drinking water and sanitation and calls fo r an integrated approach that uses \\nwater and sanitation as an entry point to unlock op portunities and empower the \\ntargeted communities.  \\nKey Words: Small Medium Enterprise, HIV/AIDS; Job C reation, Water; Sanitation     \\n1 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND \\n \\nSouth Africa has made significant economic progress  in the past decade. Although \\neconomic growth slowed down in 2009 as a result of the global recession, the overall \\nmacro-economic outlook (2009-2013) is generally pos itive (SARB, 2009). The \\ncountry has also made laudable achievements in exte nding public services such as \\neducation and health to the formerly disadvantaged black majority between 1994 and \\n2008. However the country is faced by a number of c hallenges that include low water \\nand sanitation coverage particularly in rural areas ; high unemployment rate coupled \\nwith increasing inequality; as well as HIV/AIDS and  its associated challenges.  \\n \\n1.1  Access to water and sanitation services \\n \\nClose to 6 million South Africans do not have acces s to a reliable source of safe \\ndrinking water while 13 million do not have access to adequate sanitation (DWAF, \\n2008). Figure 1 shows water and sanitation coverage  in South Africa. Consequently, \\nwater and sanitation related diseases still have a considerable public health \\nsignificance in the country. For example, diarrhoea  is among the top ten causes of \\ndeath in South Africa claiming 13600 lives annually  (or 2% of all deaths) \\u2013this \\ntranslates to 2 lives lost every hour (WHO, 2002). In addition, 479000 Disability \\nAdjusted Life Years or DALYs1 are lost annually due to diarrhoea (ibid.).  \\n                                                 \\n1 The Disability Adjusted Life Year or DALY is a hea lth gap measure that extends the concept of \\npotential years of life lost due to premature death  (PYLL) to include equivalent years of \\u2018healthy\\u2019 li fe \\nlost by virtue of being in states of poor health or  disability (1).  The DALY combines in one measure \\nthe time lived with disability and the time lost du e to premature mortality.  One DALY can be thought \\nof as one lost year of \\u2018healthy\\u2019 life and the burde n of disease as a measurement of the gap between \\ncurrent health status and an ideal situation where everyone lives into old age free of disease and \\ndisability.  \\n1.2  Unemployment and Inequality \\n \\nOne of the main challenges facing South Africa is t he persistence of a very high level \\nof unemployment. Unemployment rate in South Africa,  narrowly defined to include \\nonly those who are actively seeking employment was 26.7% in 2005, not much \\ndifferent from that of 1994 when the country achiev ed democracy (OECD, 2007). \\nUnemployment broadly defined to include discouraged  workers ( i.e. those who have \\nstopped looking for work), stood at 38.8% in the sa me year. Individuals who had \\ncompleted grades 8 to 11 ( i.e. form 1 to form 5 or secondary education) made up th e \\nlargest portion of the unemployed population (43.2% ), while only 4.2% of the \\nunemployed were individuals with postsecondary scho oling  (ibid.). This highlights \\nthe need to create employment for the low-skilled.  \\n \\nClosely linked to unemployment, is the issue of hig h and increasing inequality. In \\n2004, South Africa was remarkably number 55 in the world ( i.e . out of 171 countries) \\nbased on the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) index whi ch is a measure of economic \\ngrowth. However, in the same year South Africa rank ed number 121 on the Human \\nDevelopment Index (HDI) which is a broader measure of  welfare showing that \\nbenefits of economic growth are not reaching poorer  households (WB, 2006). South \\nAfrica\\u2019s Gini coefficient which is a measure of ine quality actually increased from \\n0.69 in 1996 to 0.77 in 2001 (HSRC, 2004). In 2002,  SA had the second highest \\ninequality coefficient in the world after Brazil.  \\n 1.3  Poverty  \\n  \\nPoverty remains stubbornly high and affects the liv es of up to about 40% of the \\npopulation (OECD, 2007). Poverty is the main charac teristic of South Africa\\u2019s rural \\nareas. For most rural communities service provision  and infrastructure has been \\ninconsequential and rural health and education faci lities are starved of resources.  Not \\nsurprisingly, poverty levels in rural areas are oft en double those in urban areas. \\nAccording to Butt, 2006, one in ten South Africans is malnourished, one in four \\nchildren is stunted, and 45% of the population live s on less than $2 a day. He further \\npoints out that, in 1999, it was estimated that aro und 45-55% of all South Africans \\nlived in conditions of poverty. \\n1.4  HIV and AIDS \\nHIV/AIDS is one of the major challenges confronting  the country. According to the \\nUNAIDS Annual Report (2007), South Africa is the co untry with the largest number \\nof HIV infections in the world. An estimated 5.7 mi llion people live with HIV. \\nMeeting the water and sanitation needs of these peo ple is a major challenge. Although \\nthese problems are discussed separately and the con ventional response is for each \\nagent or government department to focus on one issu e in line with its main thrust of \\nbusiness, at the household level these problems are  intrinsically linked and often \\nmanifest themselves at the same time.  \\n1.5  Objectives of the paper \\nThe linkages between water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), poverty and HIV/AIDS \\nhave long been recognised and several authors (Wate rAid, 2002; Kaminga and \\nWegelin-Schuringa 2005; Ngwenya and Kgathi 2006; Ob il et al., 2006; WSP, 2006; \\nBery and Rosenbaum, 2007; Clacherty and Alana Potte r, 2007; Manase, 2008) have \\nanalysed these linkages in detail. However, there i s still a dearth of information on how to address these linkages in practice when desi gning and implementing projects. \\nThe focus so far has been at policy level through f or example calls for the integration \\nof water in national Poverty Reduction Strategies ( WB, 2002; WB, 2006; Poverty-\\nEnvironment Partnership, 2006) or through the devel opment of guidelines on \\nmainstreaming HIV/AIDS in the water sector (HIP, 20 06; UNHabitate, 2007). This \\npaper contributes towards filling this knowledge ga p by demonstrating how WASH \\ncan be used as an entry point to address poverty an d HIV/AIDS at the project level. \\nUsing water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) as an en try point to address other \\nchallenges facing communities is an approach highly  recommended by the United \\nNations Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative C ouncil (WSSCC, 2002). One of \\nthe 4 key themes of the global WASH for All Campaig n launched in 2000 and spear-\\nheaded by the WSSCC is that \\u201cwater, hygiene and san itation are entry points for \\npoverty alleviation\\u201d (WSSCC, 2002, pp. 3).   South Africa launched its national \\nWASH campaign in March 2002 and adopted the global theme on \\u201cWASH as an \\nentry point for poverty alleviation\\u201d as one of its main national themes (DWAF, 2002).    \\nThe paper first discusses the linkages between WASH , Poverty and HIV/AIDS before \\npresenting the methodology and a description of the  study site. This is followed by a \\ndiscussion of the project approach and results achi eved so far. The paper concludes by \\nsummarising the discussion and making preliminary r ecommendations since the \\nproject is still in the implementation phase.  \\n2 Linkages between WASH, Poverty and HIV/AIDS \\nBetter understanding of the linkages between WASH a nd poverty (especially the \\npotential role of water in poverty alleviation) hav e led to the adoption of more \\npoverty-focused approaches in the water sector such  as Integrated Water Resources \\nManagement (IWRM) and the integration of water in n ational Poverty Reduction \\nStrategies (Poverty-Environment Partnership, 2006).  Although there are issues with \\nimplementation of these approaches (Mosley, 2004) t here is ample evidence that \\nsuggest a shift in approach away from traditional t echnical and sectoral approaches \\nbased on infrastructure development alone towards i ntegrated, demand-led \\napproaches that emphasis the role of water in econo mic growth and poverty \\nalleviation (Poverty-Environment Partnership, 2006) . South Africa has just launched its national strategy on \\u201cWater for Growth and Deve lopment 2009-2013\\u201d (DWAF, \\n2009). \\n \\n2.1  The WASH Poverty Nexus \\nGlobally, about 900 million people do not have acce ss to safe drinking water while \\nnearly one third of the world\\u2019s population, some 2. 5 billion people, do not have \\nadequate sanitation (tearfund, 2009). The majority of them, over I billion, are poor \\nliving on less than US$2 per day. The issue of ensu ring that the poor have access to \\nsafe drinking water and adequate sanitation has the refore and aptly been prominent in \\ninternational discussions, and a specific goal to r educe by half, by 2015 the number of \\npeople without access was included in the internati onally agreed Millennium \\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) (UNDP, 2009). However, the  contribution of WASH to \\npoverty reduction goes far beyond just drinking wat er and sanitation. Water for \\nexample, is essential for improving the health and livelihoods of the poor, ensuring \\nwider environmental sustainability and eradicating hunger.    \\n \\n2.2  Linkages between WASH and HIV/AIDS \\n \\nThe link between WASH and HIV/AIDS is rather comple x given the different faces \\nand dimension of HIV/AIDS (Kamminga and Wegelin-Sch uringa, 2005). However, \\nthe linkages can be categorised into two broad reci procal relationships; a) the effects \\nof WASH services on the wellbeing of People Living With HIV/AIDS (PLWH) and \\nb) the effects of HIV/AIDS on the delivery of WASH services. \\n \\n2.2.1  Effects of WASH services on the wellbeing of PLWH \\n \\nWater is life and this is more so for people living  with HIV and AIDS given their \\ncompromised immune system which make them more vuln erable to opportunistic \\ninfection (Kamminga and wegelin-Schuringa, 2005; Ng wenya and Kgathi, 2006;). \\nWater of safe quality is required when taking medic ation and when preparing formula \\nfeeding for infants with HIV positive mothers. If a  mother is HIV positive, there is a one in three risk of her transmitting the virus to her baby through breast feeding, \\n\\u201ceven if the child was born HIV negative\\u201d (Kamminga  and Wegelin-Schuringa, \\n2005). Infected mothers are therefore persuaded not  to breastfeed their children yet \\nthe chances of that child dying from diarrhoea are very high when there is no safe \\nwater to prepare formula feeds or when cleaning and  water handling practices are not \\nhygienic (ibid.). According to Bery and Rosenbaum ( 2007), diarrheal diseases which \\nare water borne or water washed are the most common  opportunistic infections (OIs) \\nexperienced by people living with HIV and AIDS in A frica and elsewhere. A random \\ncase control study by Lule et al. (2005) reported in Bery and Rosenbaum, found that \\nPLWH in the intervention group (i.e. households ran domised to use home \\nchlorination, safe water storage and basic hygiene)  reported 25% fewer episodes 2 of \\ndiarrhoea and 33 % fewer days with diarrhoea compar e to the group where the \\nintervention was basic hygiene education only (Bery  and Rosenbaum, 2007).   \\n \\nIn addition to safe quality, water for PLWH should also be of adequate quantity to \\nmeet their drinking and bathing needs. Ngwenya and Kgathi (2006) reported that end-\\nstage, bed-ridden PLWH needed 20 to 80 additional l itres of water per day depending \\non the severity of the patient\\u2019s symptoms, especial ly diarrhoea. According to the same \\nauthors, caregivers who experienced periodic water shortages reduced the frequency \\nof bathing patients from twice daily to once daily or not at all thus affecting the \\ndignity and wellbeing of the patients. Furthermore,  sanitary environments and good \\nhygiene practices are pertinent to reduce OIs among  PLWH. Lule (2005) reported that \\nthe presence of a latrine in the family compound wa s associated with fewer episodes \\nof diarrhoea among PLWH, fewer days with diarrhoea and fewer days of work lost \\ndue to diarrhoea. A study on the effects of handwas hing with soap on diarrhoea rates \\nin PLWH in the United States by Huang and Zhou repo rted a 58% reduction in \\ndiarrhoeal incidence from 2.92 episodes of diarrhoe a to 1.24 episodes (Bery and \\nRosenbaum, 2007).        \\n \\n                                                 \\n2 An episode of diarrhea was defined as \\u201ca discrete case of diarrhea having a specific beginning and \\nend and usually lasting from several days to severa l weeks\\u201d( Bery and Rosenbaum, 2007).    2.2.2  Effects of HIV/AIDS on WASH service delivery  \\nThe water sector, as is the case with any other sec tor in Southern Africa has been \\naffected by HIV/AIDS in a variety of ways. First, H IV and AIDS erode household \\nincome due to increased medical bills and general l ivelihood insecurities (Obi et al,. \\n2006). Consequently, HIV/AIDS affected households f ail to pay their water bills. This \\nreduces the budget for WASH which in turn affects t he delivery of WASH services \\nforcing affected households to resort to unsafe sou rces (Ashton, 2001) with \\ndebilitating health impacts, especially for PLWH.  \\n \\nAIDS has also increased orphans and child-headed ho useholds who may not have the \\nfinancial resources to pay for water services in ar eas where these services are charged. \\nAlso child-headed households may not be aware of hy gienic water handling and \\nsanitation practices (Obi et al ., 2006).  \\n \\nAt the institutional level, HIV/AIDS has affected W ASH service delivery through \\nabsenteeism of water operator due to ill-health, an d loss of human capital due to \\nAIDS related deaths. In Botwana, Ngwanya and Kgathi  (2006) reported high \\nfrequency absenteeism by water operators due to HIV /AIDS related illnesses or \\nattendance to funerals as one of the major reason f or unreliable water supply.      \\n \\nMore broadly, HIV/AIDS is intricately linked to pov erty alleviation and has been \\nidentified as one of the major obstacles to reachin g the Millennium Development \\nGoals (MDGs) (UNDP, 2001; Kammanga and Schuringa, 2 005). Poverty increases \\nvulnerability to HIV infection through for example high risk behaviour such as \\nprostitution for survival, while AIDS exacerbates p overty through loss of income due \\nto absenteeism or death of a bread winner (UNAIDS, 2006).  \\n \\n3 Methodology \\nThe study uses one of the projects undertaken by th e Department of Water Affairs and \\nForestry (DWAF) and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) of \\nusing WASH as an entry point to address poverty and  job creation in one of the rural \\ncommunities in South Africa. The project involves t he support of a Small Medium Enterprise (SME) in the community and income genera ted is ploughed back into the \\ncommunity. The project also includes the establishm ent of a community garden to \\nsupport the community care for people living with H IV/AIDS. \\nPurposive sampling was used to select Mvunyane a re mote, poor rural area in \\nKwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Province. Mvunyane is located a pproximately 35km south of \\nVryheid and consists of six villages which fall und er ward 14 in Abaqulusi Local \\nMunicipality of the Zululand District Municipality.  Mvunyane is described as \\u201cdeep \\nrural\\u201d, isolated former homeland with very high inc idences of poverty and HIV, and \\npoor water and sanitation coverage (IDP, 2002).  \\nThe Community-Centred Capacity Development (CCCD) c onceptual framework \\ndeveloped by the United Nations Children\\u2019s Fund (UN ICEF) was applied in this \\nproject. Community-Centred  Capacity Development \\u201ci s the strengthening and \\nnurturing of a community\\u2019s ability to take control of its own destiny and to manage \\nand direct its development process through an inter active process of Assessment, \\nAnalysis and Action (Triple A)\\u201d (UNICEF, 2005).  Se veral meetings were held during \\nwhich community members were asked to assess their situation by identifying and \\nranking their major problems; analyse priority prob lems using the causality \\nconceptual framework (i.e. identifying the immediat e, underlying and root causes of \\nthe problem); and finally develop an action plan to  address the identified problems.  \\nInformation gathered through community meetings was  supplemented by a detailed \\nbaseline survey. Proportionate systematic random sa mpling was used to select 600 out \\nof a total of 1500 households that make up Mvunyane . The household list was used as \\nthe sampling frame.   Six hundred household questio nnaires which asked for both \\nqualitative and quantitative information on househo ld characteristics, household \\neconomy, water and sanitation, and HIV/AIDS were ad ministered.  \\n4 Results of the baseline survey and discussion \\n \\n4.1  Socio-economic profile of the households \\nOf the 600 respondents interviewed, the majority (6 4.5%) are female and 35.5% are \\nmale. In the majority of cases (75%) the household- head or the spouse (20%) was \\ninterviewed. However, in 5% of the cases adult hous ehold members above 20 years old were the respondents. Most of the households ar e female-headed (54%) and the \\nmajority of the household-heads (69%) are between 4 1and 60 years old. Education \\nlevel among the household-heads is very low; 35% ha ve no formal education at all \\nand an additional 30% only went up to primary schoo l level (Grade 7).  \\n \\nThe population in the study area is relatively youn g, with the majority of the \\npopulation (84.5%) between the ages 1 to 40 years. About 45.2% of the population \\nfall within the economically active group (20-60 ye ars). However, it is also this part \\nof the population that is most under the potential threat of HIV/AIDS infection yet at \\nthe same time it is also the productive age group. \\n \\nThe data also show that about 34.5% of the total po pulation is currently of school-\\ngoing age, with the majority of the population betw een Grade 8 and 12 (Secondary \\nschool). This has implications for the delivery of good education, health and welfare \\nfacilities. Half of the population is younger than 21 years of age and only about 4.9% \\nare pensioners. This implies a high dependency rate  and an increased strain on already \\ntight household budgets. \\n \\nHousehold income in the study area is very low with  45% of the households \\ngenerating an income of less than 1000 South Africa n Rands (R) 3 per months. The \\nmajority of the households (65%) live below the nat ional poverty datum line of R353 \\nper person per month (Figure 2). The most important  source of income for the \\nmajority of the households (60%) is salaried employ ment followed by pension (20%) \\nand then social grants (10%). Other sources of inco me include formal and informal \\nbusinesses and farming.  Much of this income is spe nt on food (80%), followed by \\nmedication (10%) and electricity (5%). \\n4.2  Water, Sanitation and HIV/AIDS Situation  \\n4.2.1  Access to basic water \\nEasy access to safe and sufficient water is crucial  for the general population and \\nindispensable for people living with HIV/AIDS (Kama nga and Schuringa, 2005). \\nAlthough this study targeted the general population , some of the households included \\nin the survey have PLWH.  \\n                                                 \\n3 1USD = R7.7 as of 29 June, 2009 Households in Mvunyane collect water from multiple sources depending on the intend \\nuse of the water. Among the 600 households intervie wed, the majority reported \\nfetching water from yard taps (84%), communal token -operated taps (70%), protected \\nwell or borehole 40%, piped water inside the house (6%) and from rain water \\nharvesting (10%) (Figure 3).  However it is importa nt to note that all the yard taps in \\nthis area are illegal connections from the main lin e that supplies communal taps that \\nwere installed by DWAF.  The water supply situation  in Mvunyane is generally \\nerratic. For example, in one of the villages Esimas hwini, only 6 out of the 24 token-\\noperated communal taps (that is you have to insert prepaid token to get water) are \\noperational. The community in this village had to v andalise the token system and \\ninstall illegal connections in order to get water.   \\n \\nThe unreliability of water in the community indicat es poor water supply management \\nand maintenance.  There are no proper institutional  arrangements with regards to \\nwater supply in Mvunyane, all these issues are hand led by Zululand District \\nMunicipality (ZDM) on an ad-hoc basis. Initially DW AF was the water services \\nauthority and upon restructuring the responsibility  now lies with the Zululand District \\nMunicipality which has not effectively taken over. The situation is further \\ncomplicated by the fact that Mvunyana is governed b y a tribal authority and there are \\nno clear water supply roles and responsibilities be tween the municipality and the \\ntribal authority.  \\n \\nIn terms of water quantity 43% of the households us e less than 50 litres of water per \\nday, and a further 49% use between 50 \\u2013 100litres o f water (Figure 4). However, it \\nemerged during focus group discussions that the com munity can go for up to 3weeks \\nwithout water. Given that the average household siz e in Mvunyane is 5 people, the \\naverage quantity of water used per capita per day o f 15litres is far less than the 25 \\nlitres recommended by the National Water Act (DWAF,  2007).  This has immense \\nimplications for PLWH since water quantity is a cru cial factor in caring for PLWH, \\nespecially in the late stages of AIDS (Bery and Ros enbaum, 2007). Although this \\nbaseline survey was not specifically designed to de termine the water needs of PLWH, \\na home-based care study in Ngamiland, Botswana by N gwenya and Kgathi (2006) \\nreported that caregivers required an additional 20 to 80 liters of water per day, \\ndepending on the severity of the patient\\u2019s symptoms , especially diarrhoea.       \\n4.2.2  Access to basic sanitation \\nAdequate sanitation is equally important for povert y alleviation (WEDC, 2007) and \\nfor the prevention of opportunistic infections amon g PLWH (Bery and Rosenbaum, \\n2007).   Of the 600 households interviewed in the b aseline survey, the majority (88%) \\nreported having access to ventilated improved pit l atrines (VIPs), 0.8 % use simple pit \\nlatrines while 0.8% have no toilet facility at all (Figure 5). Although the majority of \\nthe households have access to some sort of sanitati on facility it is important to note \\nthat most of the facilities are in bad condition an d may not be effective in preventing \\nflies from leaving the toilets. Only 19% of the fac ilities were classified as being in \\ngood condition (i.e. having a vent pipe with fly sc reen, a roof and a door).  \\n \\nHaving no proper sanitation is a major challenge pa rticularly for women and people in \\nadvanced stages of AIDS. During the focus group dis cussions it emerged that those \\nwithout toilets go to the bushes or open areas to r elive themselves. Lack of access to \\nsanitation violates one\\u2019s human rights and dignity.   Presence of decomposing human \\nwaste in open spaces means people are more vulnerab le to catch water-borne diseases. \\n \\n4.3  HIV/AIDS awareness and knowledge in the community \\n \\nThe household survey indicated that the community i s aware of HIV/AIDS with 89% \\nof the households having access to HIV/AIDS informa tion. The common source of \\ninformation is radio and television; most of the ho useholds (80%) have at least one \\nradio. A significant proportion of the interviewed households (35%) reported having \\nbeen affected directly by HIV/AIDS through death of  a spouse or child or caring for \\nat least one family member living with HIV/AIDS. Th e results also indicate that 23% \\nof the households have experienced rape of a househ old member.  \\n \\n5 The project intervention  \\nAs alluded to earlier, the Community-Centred Capaci ty Development (CCCD) \\nconceptual framework which allows communities to as sess their situation, identify \\nand analyse problems and develop action plans to ad dress the identified problems was applied in this project. In order to put WASH in th e broader development context, \\ncommunities were asked to discuss their problems in  general; the CSIR team \\nmembers introduced themselves just as researchers a nd not water and sanitation \\nexperts. In order to allow equal participation, the  community was slip into the \\nfollowing three group; men, women and the youth. Ea ch group was asked to identify \\nand rank key problems facing the community in gener al. These lists were exchanged \\nallowing each group to discuss and rank problems id entified by the other two groups. \\nThe groups were then brought together and worked to gether to come up with five \\nmost pressing problems facing the community. After several hours of deliberation the \\ncommunity came up with the following list in order of priority: i) unemployment, ii) \\nwater, iii) roads, iv) HIV/AIDS, and V) crime. \\n \\nThe community was then asked to analyse each proble m by identifying the \\nimmediate, underlying and root causes of the proble ms; that is developing the \\nproblem tree (UNICEF, 2005) for each problem with t he branches as the immediate \\ncause, the trunk as the underlying cause and the ro ots as the root cause of the problem. \\nIssues of unemployment among the youth and the resu ltant turn to crime, lack of \\nspare parts for operation and maintenance of water facilities and the plight of PLWH \\nfeatured prominently during the discussions. With t echnical assistance from the CSIR \\nteam the community finally developed an integrated action plan to address the \\nidentified problems. The action plan is an innovati ve way of using WASH as an entry \\npoint to address poverty and HIV/AIDS in Mvunyane. The final action plan has the \\nfollowing 8 main components: i) problem, ii) causes , iii) objectives, iv) activities, v) \\nby whom, vi) resources, vii) outcomes, and viii) ti meframes. \\n \\nIn terms of the approach, the action plan has two m ain projects; a youth-based small \\nscale commercial enterprise that trade in water and  sanitation components (Isulabasha \\nSME) and a community garden that address the nutrit ional needs of the PLWH and \\nthe general community. This approach is in line wit h South Africa\\u2019s water sector \\nsupport program led by DWAF and dubbed \\u201cMasibambane \\u201d, which seeks to \\naddresses both the social and economic aspects of w ater and sanitation by using \\nWASH as an entry point to unlocking growth and deve lopment in the targeted \\ncommunities in addition to providing basic water an d sanitation services. In 2002, DWAF launched the national WASH campaign for South Africa with the following \\nkey themes: \\n\\u2022 Water, sanitation and hygiene can save lives \\n\\u2022 Water, hygiene and sanitation for people: women and  children come first \\n\\u2022 Reforms are critical to improving water and sanitat ion services for the poor \\n\\u2022 Water, hygiene and sanitation (WASH) are entry poin ts for poverty alleviation \\n(DWAF, 2002). \\nThe project in Mvunyane is in line with the 4th  principle of using water, hygiene and \\nsanitation (WASH) as an entry point for poverty all eviation. Several authors (Manase \\net al., 2003; Makoni et al., 2004; and Katsi et al. , 2007) have documented how \\npromoting productive use of water at household leve l while at the same time \\naddressing gender issues can generate income and cr eate employment for the locals. \\nThis project builds upon these lessons and scales u p such findings by creating a \\nformal commercial community owned small-medium ente rprise. \\n \\n5.1.1  Support to Isulabasha small-medium enterprise \\n \\nDuring the community meetings it emerged that a you th organisation named \\nIsulabasha already existed in the area. The Isulaba sha originated as a Water and \\nSanitation Project found and funded by the Departme nt of Water Affairs and Forestry \\n(DWAF) and DANIDA through the Mvula Trust, and star ted prior to the creation of \\nlocal governments. The project was initially a yout h project, hence the name \\n\\u201cIsulabasha\\u201d which means the \\u201cplan of the youth\\u201d.  \\n \\nThis project which started effectively in June 2008 , found it appropriate to revive \\nIsulabasha as opposed to building new structures. I sulabasha comprise 10 committee \\nmembers. All the committee members attended refresh er courses on financial \\nmanagement and participatory operation and maintena nce of water systems. The \\ncommittee in consultation with the community member s identified six people who \\nwere trained as water minders, plumbers and pump op erators. However, before these \\nrecruits could go to work there was a need to rehab ilitate the water facilities first and \\nfinancial resources were required. \\n Funds to rehabilitate water facilities were raised through the commercial arm of \\nIsulabasha; the Isulabasha SME created by the CSIR.  The CSIR developed a \\nhandwashing dispenser as part of its research on ap propriate technologies for \\nsustainable water supply and sanitation. The CSIR-H andwashing dispenser is a simple \\ntechnology consisting of two main components; a 2 l itre Coca Cola plastic bottle \\nwhich acts as the water container and a plastic val ve fitted at the top of the 2 litre \\nbottle. The Handwashing dispenser can be fitted eas ily on a strategic position on the \\nwall of the VIP making it easy for all family membe rs including children and the \\nelderly to wash their hands after visiting the toil et. Each complete unit costs R21. \\nBefore November, 2008 the CSIR was selling the hand washing dispenser through out \\nSouth Africa from its head office in Pretoria thus causing logistical nightmares for \\nbuyers in remote rural areas. In November 2008, the  Isulabasha SME was established \\nas the selling point for KwaZulu-Natal Province and  was provided with the first 5000 \\nunits free of charge. Within a month Isulabasha sol d 1500 unit and realised a gross \\nincome of R31500. Part of this income was used to r ehabilitate two abandoned water \\npumps in Esimashwini which is one of the 6 villages  in Mvunyane. In addition, two \\nJojo tanks were also installed thus affording commu nities a more regular water \\nsupply. Before this intervention, households report ed break-downs of up to 3 weeks. \\nHowever, since January 2009, Esimashini has receive d regular water supply and no \\nmajor breakdown has been reported.  \\n \\nIn addition to providing the initial bunch of handw ashing dispensers, the CSIR also \\nsupported Isulabasha by linking it with potential c ustomers in KwaZulu-Natal \\nProvince namely the District Municipalities, privat e contractors and Non-\\nGovernmental Organisations such as Mvula Trust. The  CSIR also assisted with \\nsecuring office equipment (a computer, furniture, f ax, telephone and internet) and \\noffice space at the nearest town, Vryheid to bring Isulabasha more exposure to the \\nmarket. Isulabasha has expanded its activities to i nclude charging for photocopying, \\nfax, and phone services. These are the activities t hat promote the SME\\u2019s operations \\nand enhance economic viability while at the same ti me expanding and promoting \\nwater sanitation and hygiene in the community.  \\n \\nBetween January and May 2009, the average monthly i ncome and running costs for \\nIsulabasha were R21000 and R10500 respectively. Thi s translates to a monthly profit of R10500. This money is currently being used to re habilitate water facilities in three \\nmore villages.   \\n \\n5.1.2  Community Garden for people living with HIV/AIDS \\nAlthough HIV/AIDS is not a water-related disease, t he issues are closely linked. For  \\nexample, many of the opportunistic infections that kill people living with HIV/AIDS \\nare transmitted through contaminated water and unsa nitary living conditions (WSP, \\n2008). The links also include safe drinking water f or home-based care and infant \\nfeeding; and food security and income generation th rough productive use of water. \\nTherefore increasing food production and food secur ity through community gardening \\ncan be one of the solutions to assisting people liv ing with HIV/AIDS in these \\ncommunities. \\n \\nCommunity gardening meets varying needs of diverse communities, especially those \\nin marginalized neighbourhoods struggling with hung er and poverty. The community \\ngarden which is run by Isulabasha addresses lack of  access to fresh produce in \\nMvunyane. Therefore the garden is crucial in meetin g the community\\u2019s nutritional \\nneeds and food security. The community garden allow s people to grow crops they \\nmay not be able to find elsewhere, this can mean be ing able to maintain a traditional \\ndiet and be healthier and happier. One of the Isula basha committee members donated \\nhis 2 hectors piece land for the community garden. The CSIR then assisted the \\ncommunity by linking them with the department of Ag riculture for advice on best \\ncrops to plant in the area, and also by securing eq uipment to fence the area. Since \\nthere is not enough water in this area, the CSIR is  provided a Jojo tank which is being \\nused to store water for irrigating the vegetables.  \\n \\nThe community harvested its first crop in October 2 008. Then, only half of the garden \\nwas planted and much of the vegetable was used to f eed PLWH. However, in \\nDecember 2008 the community managed to plant the wh ole 2 hectors and produced \\nsurplus vegetables which were sold to the general c ommunity and a child feeding \\npoint. Between February and May 2009 the community generated an average income \\nof R7400 per month and the average input costs (see ds, fertiliser and pesticides) were \\nR21000 per month. At the moment the income is mainl y saved in the bank since the community would like to expand its activities. The community has been approached \\nto supply a local supermarket and the local chief g ave them a boost by allocating them \\na 7 hector piece of land to enable them to meet the  growing demand for vegetables.  \\n \\n6 Conclusion \\n \\nMvunyane is facing a number of challenges that incl ude poor water supply and \\nsanitation, poverty as well as HIV/AIDS and its ass ociated challenges. Although this \\nproject is still in its infancy it is already demon strating how water and sanitation can \\nbe used as an entry point to address these challeng es. Earlier projects that focused \\nsolely on water and sanitation were not sustainable  pointing to the need for more \\nholistic approaches and community participation in planning, implementation and \\noperation and maintenance. Preliminary results from  Esimashwini where this project \\nis almost in full swing suggest that the water supp ly situation has improved as \\nevidenced by the fact that no major breakdown has b een reported to the CSIR by the \\nvillage pump minder. Before this intervention commu nities used to go for up to 3 \\nweeks without water as reported during the baseline  survey. The community \\nownership of the project and enthusiasm is amazing.  There are also signs of \\ncommunity mobilisation beyond this project as illus trated by the formation of women \\nclubs to curb child abuse and other crimes in the a rea. \\n \\nThe importance of integrated planning that includes  all the relevant sectors such as the \\nwater sector, Local Municipality and the Ministries  of Health and Agriculture can not \\nbe over emphasised. Getting all these stakeholders to work smoothly together is a \\nchallenge still facing the project although progres s is being made. It is strongly \\nrecommended that water and sanitation projects shou ld integrate HIV/AIDS and job \\ncreation. Local Integrated Development Plans (IDP) at municipal level should be used \\nas an instrument to achieve this integration. \\n \\n7 References  \\n \\nAshford, L.

Lastb*\\naINIQUI, Facultad de Ingenier\\u0131 \\u00b4a, Universidad Nacional de Salta, Argentina;bPulmonary and Critical\\nCare Medicine, School of Medicine, University of California, Davis, CA, USA\\n(Received XXX; \\ufb01nal version received XXX)\\nIn the province of Salta, in the Northwest region of Argentina, almost two-thirds of the\\npopulation live in absolute poverty, and diseases associated with poverty are rampant.Almost 12% of the total population of the province are children below five years of age;almost half of these infants are living in situations where the basic necessities are not\\navailable. Primitive sanitary conditions, including widespread contamination of available\\nwater supplies with pathogens, contribute to a major public health problem. Infantmortality was 17% higher for Salta than for Argentina as a whole in 2001. A major cause\\nof death for these children is infectious disease, especially respiratory and intestinal\\ndiseases. In Salta, more than half of the total population of infants is affected bydiarrhoea annually. The infectious pathogens are diverse: bacteria (predominantly inspring and summer), viruses (especially in the winter) and parasites (endemic in some\\nsituations). This paper evaluates current methods used to test for the presence of\\npathogens in drinking water; discusses why these methods are less than adequate;documents an episode of contamination in a local water supply source; and suggestsappropriate methods that can be used to better address this major public health issue\\neffectively.\\nKeywords: infectious disease; public health policies; poverty; Latin America; infant\\nmortality\\nIntroduction\\nIn Latin America, economic globalisation has meant the increased movement of people\\nand goods and changes in environmental and occupational health hazards, often occurring\\nin the context of political and economic instability. It has also meant that health risks arebeing transferred. Of the estimated 183 million people living in poverty in Latin America,more than half are children and teenagers, 72% of them live in urban areas, and mortalityand morbidity impact especially the infant population, from zero to five years old (Puga2001). Acute respiratory infections (mainly pneumonia), diarrheoa, measles, malaria (andfrequently a combination of them) are the most common causes of morbidity andmortality among children under the age of five in the developing world, with diarrhoea and\\nrespiratory infections being the two most common causes. Diarrhoea can be defined as\\nloose, watery and frequent stools. It is considered chronic or persistent when loose orfrequent stools last for more than two weeks. The World Health Organisation (WHO)estimates that about 1.5 million deaths per year from diarrhoeal diseases, mainly inchildren, are attributable to environmental factors such as contaminated drinking water,5\\n10\\n15\\n20\\n25\\n30\\n35AQ1\\n*J.A.

This report observes\\nthat a large portion of the total burden of diarrhoeal disease is caused by fecal-oralpathogens from both human and animal sources. It has been estimated that diarrhoealdiseases accounted for 5.3% of deaths and 3.5% of Disability-Associated Life Years(DAL Y\\u2019s) in European children aged 0 /C114 (Valent et al. 2004).\\nMalnutrition frequently accompanies these diseases, and is a primary factor contribut-\\ning to the complications of both diarrhoea and pneumonia, although the causal links andmechanisms remain unclear. Other factors than the nutritional status of infants andchildren influence the incidence of diarrhoea, including socioeconomic status, disruptionof traditional lifestyles, accessibility to clean water and sanitation facilities, age and theirbreast-feeding status. Infants and children throughout the developing world suffer manyepisodes of diarrhoea each year. Diarrhoea of any duration may have adverse effects on achild\\u2019s health, especially due to the potential for producing cumulative negative effects onnutritional status. However, major morbidity results from complications of acute diarrhoeaand dehydration, as well as the development of persistent diarrhoea. These complicationsare responsible, in turn, for the great majority of diarrhoeal mortality (Schorling 1996).\\nWith the use of oral glucose-electrolyte rehydration solution, the vast majority of\\ndeaths from acute, non-invasive diarrhoeas could be prevented. However, a group of more\\nchronically debilitating, persistent diarrhoeas are emerging as a major health problem.There are many possible mechanisms of persistent diarrhoea, including anatomicconsiderations, allergic phenomena, manifestations of systemic disease and infectiousagents. However, most of these have not been seriously examined in the context of childrenin the developing world. There are many explanations for the complex syndrome ofpersistent diarrhoea in children. It seems that many host factors (malnutrition, immunestatus, etc.) and sociocultural considerations (age of weaning, concepts of child care andcultural definitions of health and disease states) are inseparable from the microbiologicaland gastrointestinal physiological causes.\\nIn Argentina, emerging infectious diseases have increasingly been detected, starting\\nwith epidemic outbreaks of Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF) in the 1950s, humanimmunodeficiency virus infection (HIV)/AIDS and leishmaniasis in the 1980s, andcholera, antimicrobial resistance, hantavirus and dengue in the 1990s (Segura 2001).These illnesses are related to deterioration of the public and individual environment. Otherillnesses, like trichinosis, are more dependent on the quality of alimentation. Tuberculosisand Chagas are also present with a high impact in the north of the country (MSA andPAHO-WHO 2003).\\nDiarrhoea in Argentina and in Salta\\nThe total number of children in Argentina below five years old is around 3.5 million, about\\n9.4% of the population. About 130,000 of these infants are in Salta province, representingalmost 12% of the population. In Salta, 62% of the total population lives in absolutepoverty, and about 42% of the infants (under five years old) are living in situations wherethe basic necessities are not available (SAP-UNICEF 2003). These indexes are reflected inthe sanitary situation.\\nFor Argentina, the infant mortality was 16.3 per thousand births, and the neonatal\\nmortality was 10.6 per thousand in 2001, while comparable data were 19.1 and 11.4 forSalta, respectively. After external causes of death and congenital malformations,deformations and chromosomal anomalies, the main causes of death are infections,respiratory and intestinal in many cases (Dura \\u00b4n 2003).

The public health budget was mainly used for\\nemergencies, while prevention was neglected.

Contaminated water\\nand foods are the principal carriers of human-specific pathogens. Poor hygiene is alsoconsidered a major cause. More than 15 different groups of viruses, including more than\\n140 distinct types, have been found in the human intestine and may be discharged to the\\naquatic environment in wastewater (Leclerck et al. 2004). The viruses identified with highermorbidity rates for grastrointestinal diseases are rotavirus, astrovirus, norovirus (NoV),\\nadenovirus serotypes 40 and 41 and enterovirus.\\nRotavirus is the main cause of diarrhoea hospitalisations among children worldwide.\\nRotavirus reportedly caused approximately 22% of childhood diarrhoea hospitalisationsbetween 1986 and 1999, and the proportion increased to 39% from 2000 to 2004 (Parashar\\net al. 2006). Rotavirus annually causes 111 million episodes of diarrhoea requiring home\\ncare only, 25 million clinic visits, two million hospitalisations, and an average of 440,000deaths in children under the age of five years, 82% of whom live in developing countries\\n(Parashar et al. 2003). In Argentina, studies showed the high impact of infection\\n(Giordano et al. 2001), identified the prevalent serotypes (Bok et al. 2001, Castello et al.2006, Stupka et al. 2007), and showed the economic benefits (direct medical cost savings)\\nof effective vaccination (Go \\u00b4mez et al. 1998).\\nHuman astroviruses (HAstVs) are associated with gastrointestinal illness, especially in\\nchildren; they also produce diarrhoea in adults and immunocompromised patients. These\\nviruses may be responsible for outbreaks in schools, daycare centres, and other closed\\npopulations. Astrovirus was found in 40/1070 (3.7%) of fecal specimens collected inMendoza over a three-year study period. Of the 1070 children studied, 62% required\\nhospitalisation and HAstVs was found in 3.9% of these cases. Among outpatients, the virus\\nwas detected in 3.5% of 402 children (Espul et al. 2004). Another epidemiological andclinical study, carried out in Cordoba, reported that astroviruses contributed 12.4% of the\\noverall morbidity from diarrhoea (Giordano et al. 2004).\\nNoV, a calicivirus, is a major causative agent of viral gastroenteritis, affecting all age\\ngroups worldwide (Radford et al. 2004). NoVs are genetically and antigenically diverse andcannot be cultured, which made diagnosis and identification difficult historically. Newer\\nmolecular methods for identification have solved this problem. In Argentina, the first work\\non Norwalk-like virus and Sapporo-like virus (also caliciviruses) variability was studied inchildren with diarrhoea in Mendoza (Martinez et al. 2002).\\nAdenoviruses cause respiratory diseases (bronchitis, pneumonia, broncheolitis),\\npharyngoconjunctival fever, gastroenteritis, epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, encephalome-ningitis, and herpes. Serotypes 40 and 41 are major causes of diarrhoea in children and are\\nof sufficient concern to public health to have been placed by the US EPA on its\\nContaminant Candidate List for drinking water (Ko et al. 2005). In Cordoba, Argentina, astudy on 133 cases of hospitalised children with acute diarrhoea identified several viruses,\\nincluding rotavirus 84%, astrovirus 10.7%, adenovirus 40/413.6% and dual rotavirus-\\nastrovirus infection 1.7% (Giordano et al. 2001).\\nThe human enterovirus family, which includes poliovirus, echoviruses and Coxsackie A\\nand B viruses, produces various diseases such as meningitis, encephalitis, poliomyelitis,\\ncold, stomatitis-herpangina-hand-foot-mouth syndrome, pharyngitis, myocarditis, neona-\\ntal sepsis, diabetes mellitus, and gastroenteritis (Liste et al. 2000, Nowak-Wegrzyn et al.2001, Elfaitoure et al. 2005). In Argentina, a viral meningitis outbreak in Tucuman was\\ndetected in 2003 (Freire et al. 2003), and enterovirus was related to central nervous system\\ninfections (Mistchenko et al. 2006).120\\n125\\n130\\n135\\n140\\n145\\n150\\n155\\n160\\n165AQ2Global Public Health 5Y:/Taylor & Francis/RGPH/articles/RGPH344894/RGPH344894.3d[x] Wednesday, 17th SeptemberUNCORRECTED PROOFMicrobiological quality of water\\nThe microbial quality of water resources and the management of microbial-laden wastes\\ngenerated by animal and agricultural industries are critical local, regional and national\\nproblems. Animal wastes can contain high concentrations of microorganisms that are\\npathogenic to humans. In addition, urban storm events may convey significant numbers ofpathogens to areas where they can persist, providing risk during subsequent exposure. The\\npresence of human pathogens in source water has been a concern of municipalities because\\ndisease-causing agents may have negative health implications for those individuals that\\ncome in contact with the water. In addition, the level of source water contamination may\\nbe used to determine the extent of treatment processes needed to ensure public safety.\\nCurrent regulations are based on the use of culture-based methods for the detection of\\nindicator organisms. Coliforms have been used as indicator organisms for the micro-\\nbiological quality of water and serve as the basis for regulations and policy guidance.\\nHowever, many studies have demonstrated that coliforms are not representative of certain\\nkinds of contamination (Hardina and Fujioka 1991, Ferguson et al. 1996, Schroeder et al.\\n2002). A large epidemiological study that examined the health risks along Mission BayPark in San Diego did not find any correlation between indicator bacteria and illness\\ncontracted by beachgoers (results presented at the National Beaches Conference, San\\nDiego, 2004). Thus, decisions based on detection of indicator organisms often result insignificant costs and may have no benefit to public health. Since these methods are based\\non microorganism viability, results may give an underestimation of the real contamination.\\nIn addition, many pathogens cannot be cultured using conventional means.\\nColiform indicators may have various sources (animals, birds, reptiles, soil); thus,\\ndemonstration of the presence of coliforms in a water sample may not document a direct\\nrelationship with human fecal material. Conversely, enterovirus and adenovirus are\\nhuman-specific and indicate that water has come into direct contact with human pollution\\n(Noble et al. 2003). For indicator bacteria to be useful as a public health tool, increasedcounts should correlate with the presence of human-specific viruses. Positive results for\\nfecal coliforms (FC) do not tell about the origin, either human or animal, of the\\ncontamination, an issue that must be considered at the time of assessing the risk for publichealth. A wide range of alternative microbial and chemical indicators have been\\ninvestigated for potential differentiation of fecal sources (Scott et al. 2002, Gilpin et al.\\n2003, Kildare et al. 2007). Many new watershed protection initiatives are focusing on\\nemerging technologies for the identification of sources of fecal contamination. This\\napproach, called Microbial Source Tracking (MST), relies on genetic profiles ofmicroorganisms using either cultured or uncultured target cells. The US Geological\\nSurvey Water Quality Office maintains a database and bibliography on emerging\\ntechniques in MST (http://water.usgs.gov/owq/microbial.html).\\nMST based on the detection of Bacteroidales (Bernhard and Field 2000) appears to be\\na promising tool for detecting microbial contamination in water. This method has been\\nused in several studies (Colford et al. 2007), including the Mission Bay Bacterial SourceIdentification Study (Gruber et al. 2005) and the Calleguas Watershed study (Kildare et al.\\n2007), and revealed that high indicator counts can be attributed to non-human sources,\\nsuch as birds near beaches. It is likely that routine coliform counting done in Salta (andelsewhere) is systematically overestimating the risk from E. coli and Salmonella , while\\ntotally ignoring more serious threats from various non-bacterial pathogens. Interestingly,\\nno signal for human-derived 16S rRNA genes of Bacteroidales was found at storm drains.\\nThe Bacteroidales group consists of anaerobic, fecal bacteria, which are good indicators of170\\n175\\n180\\n185\\n190\\n195\\n200\\n205\\n2106V .B.

In comparison to coliform counts, the molecular-based\\ndetection of Bacteroidales offers a precise method and specific target group (Dick et al.\\n2005), whereas various microbial groups contribute to coliform counts. Both human andnon-human sources contribute Bacteroidales and coliform-forming bacteria to water\\nsources, so MST is a powerful tool to classify the types of contamination. The rapidlygrowing database of Bacteroides sequences from humans and various animals will make it\\npossible to design Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) primers and probes that not onlydifferentiate, but also quantify, the contribution of Bacteroides -fecal contamination by\\nspecific sources. This method has a huge potential for tracking the source of microbialcontamination; however, the research area is new, and a correlation between human-derived Bacteroidales sequences and the presence of human pathogens has not yet been\\nestablished.\\nHuman-specific viruses are the cause for numerous infectious illnesses, and can\\npotentially be used as a tracer of human fecal contamination. Human adenoviruses and\\nenteroviruses have been frequently found in urban rivers associated with human fecal\\ncontamination as well as in polluted coastal waters. European studies have suggested usingadenovirus as an index of human viral pollution since this virus has often been detected insamples contaminated with human fecal material (Pina et al .1998). Similarly, enteroviruses\\nfound in activated sludge, sewage outfalls, and fresh and marine waters are also associatedwith human fecal contamination (Noble et al. 2003).\\nOther methods besides culture-based detection of microorganisms are also available.\\nThe use of molecular techniques has increased tremendously in recent years withimprovements in technology and knowledge. These methods offer the advantages ofsensitivity, specificity, selectivity and rapid results. All these aspects are crucial whenmaking decisions related to human health risk. Protocols for the PCR, non-quantitative orquantitative, are continuously being developed. There are a wide variety of publicationsand references related to the detection of pathogens (bacteria, viruses or parasites) by PCRin different kinds of samples. However, environmental samples (soil, water) are complex\\nmatrixes that can contain many different substances that inhibit the DNA amplification\\nreaction, thereby decreasing the detection limit of the method (Wilson 1997, Cullen andHirsch 1998, Harry et al. 1999, Chandler et al. 2000, Burtscher and Wuertz 2003, Strauband Chandler 2003, Rajal et al. 2007a, 2007b). The number of viruses in water can be verylow, so the concentration of water samples prior to PCR analysis becomes a necessity.Quantitative recovery of viruses can prove to be a difficult task due to low recoveries ofvirus because of losses during conventional filtration (Schroeder et al. 2002). Tangentialultrafiltration by hollow fiber seems to allow better recovery of viruses (Winona et al. 2001,Morales-Morales et al. 2003). Methodology to optimise the efficient recovery of humanviruses from water was recently developed and validated (Rajal et al. 2007a).\\nWater quality issues and diarrhoea in Salta\\nThe Arias and Arenales rivers join together west of Salta (capital city of Salta province) to\\nform the Arenales River (does this make sense?). The river runs through much of theProvince of Salta; initially through a semi-rural area where the main uses are water supplyfor a drinking water plant (DWP), agricultural irrigation and fresh water for livestockmaintenance. After that, the river crosses the city of Salta and continues to the south todischarge in the Cabra Corral reservoir, which provides water for different uses and forhydroelectric energy to locations downstream.215\\n220\\n225\\n230\\n235\\n240\\n245\\n250\\n255\\n260AQ2Global Public Health 7Y:/Taylor & Francis/RGPH/articles/RGPH344894/RGPH344894.3d[x] Wednesday, 17th SeptemberUNCORRECTED PROOFThe city of Salta has grown a great deal in the last decade. This growth was not\\norganised and population expanded to occupy places where the basic services (water,sanitation) were not available. Crossing the city, the river receives the impact of point andnon-point source pollution: illegal discharges of domestic wastewater without treatment,storm water, illegal and improper solid waste disposal, and discharges of industrialeffluents. The water is used for many purposes: domestic in the poorest areas (hygiene,cooking, watering plants and vegetables that are grown for self consumption, animals,etc.), recreational where children are the users, and industrial. The population exposed tosuch impacts is significant. Studies on chemical contamination showed the necessity ofregular monitoring of the river (Musso 2000). Salta\\u2019s Provincial Environmental Labora-tory currently measures some physicochemical parameters, inorganic compounds andindicator bacteria (but not viruses because the technology was not available) at a fewlocations. Real-time PCR assays are currently being set up for that purpose.\\nCurrent water legislation establishes that microbiological quality of water is assessed by\\nmeasurement of indicator bacteria: total coliforms (TC) and FC. We have analysed TC andFC (Most Probable Number method, MacConkey Broth (Eaton et al. 1998), in the\\nArenales River and an associated irrigation channel in a semi-rural area west of Salta\\nduring the dry season (June /C1August 2006). Average mean temperature in this region is\\n17.18C and average mean rainfall is about 67 cm. There is a plant in this area that makes\\ndrinking water for the local municipalities. Four sampling sites were chosen at the river(R1/C1R4, Figure 4) and at the irrigation channel (C1 /C1C4, Figure 4). Additionally, samples\\nat the local school (S, Figure 4) were analysed from the water supply network (S /C1T) and\\nfrom their own well (S /C1W), both sources of drinking water at different times of the day.\\nOur results (see Table 1) showed counts exceeding existing standards for TC and FC\\n(see Table 2) in two-thirds of the samples analysed. There are many farms (mainly avian)on the margins of the river and the channel. In particular, there is a large one between R2and R3 and six others right before C3. This site (C3) also receives the impact of astabilisation pond and of a mini-dump. Lower TC and FC counts verify the remediationcapability after R3 and C3. This high-risk situation for public health becomes worse due tosome socioeconomical issues. The farmers need additional help during harvest and theusual solution is to hire cheap temporary workers, usually from Bolivia, who workseasonally. These \\u2018golondrina\\u2019 workers are usually illegal immigrants living within minimal\\nhygiene and sanitation conditions. They often drink raw water from the irrigation channel\\nduring work.\\nThe water fed into the DWP (Figure 4), according to our results for sample C4 (Table 1),\\nexceeded the guidance values for TC and FC considering that only filtration anddisinfection (option ain Table 2) are performed. Proof of the defective product was the\\ncontamination found in the drinking water sample (S /C1T) from the school (S in Figure 4),\\nwhich is located 100 m from the DWP . The other source of drinking water there,groundwater, presented a TC value in excess of the Guidance value (S /C1W , Table 1). This\\nis a frequent problem for that area since most of the wells (including private properties) arenot deep enough (3 /C110 meters) to be isolated from the high environmental burden, taking\\ninto account the characteristics of the soils.\\nDiarrhoea episodes are very common in the area.

However, the\\ntrue correlation between diarrhoea and polluted water is barely established. GIS offers thepossibility of generating and analysing hypotheses regarding disease distribution andcausation.

Modern commu-nication systems and data organisation and sharing methods, together with softwaredevelopment, allow information integration to assist epidemiology analysis.\\nThe use of QMRA techniques are supplementing and according to Haas (2002),\\neventually will supplant, the use of indicator approaches in regulating the quality ofdrinking waters. Deposition and scour may play a significant role in water bodies in urbanareas, especially after runoff events, when the counts of microorganisms are still high andexposure is most likely to occur.\\nAn important question regards the potential extension of these observations to the\\npublic health area. If PCR seems to be a more reliable indicator of the occurrence ofpathogens in drinking water than assessment of coliforms by plate counting, what shouldwe do about it? Public health authorities worldwide are invested intellectually andfinancially in training and methodology for evaluation of water quality by plate countingfor coliform bacterial counts. A major disadvantage of PCR, especially in developingcountries, is the high cost of analysis per sample when it is used as a routine method.However, rapid results should allow us to identify contaminated water, treat it335\\n340\\n345\\n350\\n355\\n360Table 3.

When these factors areconsidered, high analysis costs are often offset by the benefits represented by reducedillness, reduced mortality, and lower overall health costs.\\nThe particular area presented in this paper, which does not reflect the situation for the\\nwhole province of Salta, lacks a system able to provide safe water in a continuousoperational mode. The DWP treats water from the irrigation channel, which is derived\\nfrom the river, to produce drinking water. The irrigation channel does not contain water of\\nthe quality required for drinking water. The drinking water produced at the plant aftertreatment is not safe regarding the microbiological load detected (the water supply is inprivate hands and the lack of control by the government is evident).\\nThe water stress in the area is a driving force to use water, intended for other\\napplications, as irrigation, or from other sources, like groundwater. Water from theirrigation channel, which receives the impact of at least one farm, is sometimes used asdrinking water by some of the temporary workers. Water from the channel is also used for\\nwashing laundry when the water supply at home is not adequate. On the other hand,\\ngroundwater supply comes from wells that are not deep enough /C1less than 10 m /C1to ensure\\nthe absence of microbial contamination. The characteristics of the soils are such that theimpact of land use strongly affects shallow groundwater showing high nitrate (agriculture)and ammonia (farms) concentration, as well as high coliform counts, probably due to thecloseness of septic tanks.\\nIn summary, water management, water use and hygiene, factors that cannot be\\nseparated from water quality, together with the global health situation associated with\\npoverty (malnutrition, accessibility to the health system, population settlements in areas\\nwithout sanitary services and susceptible to flooding, etc.), contribute to the increase ofdiarrhoea cases and add complexity to the already compromised situation of the area.Water quality, as shown here, is not the main factor determining diarrhoea cases; however,monitoring the water quality will help to make decisions to prevent rather than to curewaterborne illnesses.\\nAcknowledgements\\nThe authors want to thank especially the personnel from the school and the health centre involved in\\nthis study.

Access to water on the other \\nhand entails varying types of quality and cost of getting water for use \\nboth spatially and temporally. Cost here is in terms of water price and \\ntime spent both vertically and ho rizontally to get water. Unequal \\ndistribution and access to natural resources may be due to resource \\nscarcity, poverty and deprivation.  Access to water has been an \\nimportant issue, for example, scarcity of water is recently becoming \\nan important phenomeno n in view of its consequences on the lives and \\nlivelihood of people, water scarcity and water poverty are serious \\nissues which have given rise to absolute poverty in many parts of \\ndeveloping countries.  \\nWater use can be categorized into 5: drinking water, domestic water, \\nfood security needs, economic production and environmental needs. \\nWater scarcity on the other hand can also be of 5 types: physical AFRREV STECH, Vol. 3(2 ) May, 2014 \\nCopyright\\u00a9 IAARR 2014 : www.afrrevjo.net   53 \\nIndexed  and Listed in AJOL, ARRONET  security, economic security, managerial security, institutional security \\nand political security.  Water Pove rty describes a situation where a \\npeople cannot afford the cost of sustainable clean water to its citizens \\nat the right quantity and time. It encapsulates the relationship between \\navailability and access to water and the socio -economic status of an \\nindivid ual or group of people. People can be water poor in the sense \\nof not having sufficient water for their needs either because it is not \\navailable; or   due to walking a long distance to get to the nearest \\nwater point.  Just like people are income poor, one m ay also be water \\npoor, especially when water is available but people lack affordability \\n(Lawrence, et al., 2002). According to Sullivan (2002) and Sullivan \\nand Meigh (2003) a close association exist between income poverty \\nand water poverty.  Indeed, withou t adequate and efficient water \\nsupply, any measure to reduce income poverty may be unsuccessful.  \\nSeveral indicators have been employed to quantify water accessibility \\nand water scarcity, some of which are: Falkenmark indicator, human \\ndevelopment index, s ocial water stress index, water scarcity index, \\nwater resource vulnerability index, index of local relative water use \\nand reuse, watershed sustainability index, water supply stress index, \\npopulation growth impacts of water resource availability, water stre ss \\nindicators, life cycle assessment, etc. Indeed, about 34 agri -\\nenvironmental and 50 economic and social indicators have been \\ndocumented (Gleick, 2002; Falkenmark, 1989; Anderson, 1991; \\nGleick, 1996; Salameh, 2000; Vidal, 2002; Molle and Mollinga, 2003; \\nAsheesh, 2004), etc.  According to Heidecke (2006)  indicators do not \\nprovide sufficient details especially when working  on water resource \\nassessment  on a smaller scale, despite the fact that a high level of  \\ndetail  is  required  for such an exercise (Fe itelson and Chenoweth, \\n2002; Moll and Mollinga, 2003). However, out of the indices above \\nWater Poverty Index has been fingered to be the most efficient tool.  It \\nis easy to calculate, easy to implement, it is based mostly on existing \\ndata, and it assist in  priotizing water needs.     \\nThere are 5 approaches for computing WPI   these are: composite \\nindex approach, time -analysis approach, a gap approach, Jarman The Use of Composite Water Poverty Index in Assessing Water Scarcity...

The climate of Oyo State exhibits \\nthe tropical climate of averagely high temperature, high relative \\nhumidity and generally low rainfall maxima regimes during the \\nrainfall period. Dry season lasts from November to March while wet \\nseason starts from March and ends in October.  Rainfall amount varies \\nfrom an average of 1200mm around Igbeti in the northern part of the \\nState to  1800mm in Igbo -Ora and Ibarapa zone in the southern part. \\nHowever, wet season is usually characterised by high f surface runoff \\nwith high humidity especially in the southern part of the State.  \\nThe landscape is largely undulating; the Yoruba and Kukuruku \\nhighland is quite prominent in the state. The rocks consist of old hard \\nrocks and dome shaped inselberg hills, which rise gently from a bout \\n500metres in the southern part and reaching a height of about \\n1,219metres above sea level in the northern part around Igbeti.

Permissibly Poor   \\nThis sub group appear to have the highest   access to water in the \\nstudy area, with WPI of between 45 -49% which is the highest in the \\nstudy area.  Atisbo LGA is in this category.  This is in view of its high \\nscore of the WPI sub components such as resources (15.66) and \\naccess to water (14.29). The strong resource base in Atisbo LGA is \\nexpected in view of the fact that it is the food basket of the state, \\nwhere food crops such as maize, cassava, etc are produced in \\ncommercia l quantity.  In addition, to food crops, tobacco is a common \\ncommercial produce crop in the LGA, with the British Tobacco \\nhaving a strong presence. This suggests access to other sources of \\nincome.  Azeez and Jimoh (2007) also reported a strong farmers unio n \\nin the LGA. In addition, agro -forestry and gemstone mining are also \\nimportant human activities. These show a relatively stronger level of \\nlivelihood. All these explain the relatively high WPI in the LGA, \\nparticularly in Ofiki town which is renowned for h igh economic \\nactivity.

Moderately Poor  \\nAccess in this category ranges from 33.9 to 34.70%. Three LGAs are \\nfound in this category. They are: Afijio, Kajola and Ogo -Oluwa. \\nThese LGAs have a relatively strong resource base and have some \\nlevel of access to water. Majority of people in these LGAs combined \\none or more employment with such as   farming, trading and civil \\nservice. These 3 LGAs have high population of schools and large \\npopulation of teachers and farmers; hence, they enjoyed a strong \\nlivelihood base. Yam flour business and Yam and cassava farming are \\ndominant business particularly in Ogo - Oluwa which happens to \\nsupply these products to many western and northern Nigerian ma rkets. \\nBig national food stuff markets are found in many parts of these \\nLGAs.  \\nc. Very Poor  \\nTwenty LGAs are found here of which values of WPI ranges between \\n18.86 in Surulere to 28.92% in Surulere to Oluyole LGAs. These \\ncategories of LGAs have relatively weak resource base and poor \\naccess to water and resources compared to what obtains in the two \\ncategories above. The residents are largely local farmers who depend \\nmainly on food and seasonal fruits crops; peasant agricultural \\nproduction is a common occupation i n these LGAs.  Access to water \\nis as low as 3.83 in Surulere; water use is 0.80, the environment also \\nscored low.
