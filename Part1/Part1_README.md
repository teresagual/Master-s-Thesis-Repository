This folder contains the code for the first part of the Master's Thesis. Below, the code files in this folder are listed along with a brief description of their functionality.
1. **00_Prepare_Excel_With_Texts**: Extracts text and references from PDFs and saves data to CSV.
2. **01_SDG_Allocation_SDG1**: The code identifies SDGs in scientific articles and generates reports in CSV/Excel with the results. This corresponds to SDG 1, but it can also be applied to the rest of the SDGs with minimal changes.
3. **02_SDG_InteractionWithCleanWater_Water_SDG1**: The code extracts and visualizes the relationships between SDG 6 and the other SDGs identified in the code 01_SDG_Allocation_SDG1. This corresponds to SDG 1, but it can also be applied to the rest of the SDGs with minimal changes.
4. **03_InteractionTrade_off_SDG-SDG6**: Classify the relationships between the SDGs and SDG 6 identified as "trade-offs" in the code "02_SDG_InteractionWithCleanWater_Water_SDG.ipynb" as "Genuine Trade-off," "Non-compliance with SDG 6," and "Methodological Issue".
5. **03_InteractionTrade-off_SDG6-SDG**: It does the same as the "03_InteractionTrade_off_SDG-SDG6" code but in reverse, meaning it classifies the relationships between SDG 6 and the rest.
6. **04_InteractionSynergy_SDG_SDG6**:
